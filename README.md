# Tetris-RL
The code implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to learn and play Tetris through reinforcement learning. It defines the Tetris environment and trains the DQN agent using experience replay and a neural network to approximate Q-values. The agent's performance is visualized, and its parameters can be saved.
